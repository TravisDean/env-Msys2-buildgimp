This is my setup of Msys2 for compiling Gimp from source, for Windows, on Windows.

All necessary packages are either installed from pacman or built from source.

I will be adding extensive sections on the current changes and commands necessary to 
setup the entire environment from scratch.

Current status:
    Builds Gimp 2.9.3
    Lacks python-fu plugin support
